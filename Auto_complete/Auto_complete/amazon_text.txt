So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter. <eos>
Good case, Excellent value. <eos>
Great for the jawbone. <eos>
Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!! <eos>
The mic is great. <eos>
I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume. <eos>
If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one. <eos>
If you are Razr owner...you must have this! <eos>
Needless to say, I wasted my money. <eos>
What a waste of money and time!. <eos>
And the sound quality is great. <eos>
He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery. <eos>
If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset. <eos>
Very good quality though <eos>
The design is very odd, as the ear "clip" is not very comfortable at all. <eos>
Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone. <eos>
I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED! <eos>
So Far So Good!. <eos>
Works great!. <eos>
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last. <eos>
I went on Motorola's website and followed all directions, but could not get it to pair again. <eos>
I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it! <eos>
The commercials are the most misleading. <eos>
I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging. <eos>
I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery. <eos>
Great Pocket PC / phone combination. <eos>
I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had. <eos>
I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me. <eos>
People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone. <eos>
Doesn't hold charge. <eos>
This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible. <eos>
This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive. <eos>
It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed. <eos>
I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone. <eos>
Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended <eos>
You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short. <eos>
It has kept up very well. <eos>
Poor Talk Time Performance. <eos>
The case is great and works fine with the 680. <eos>
worthless product. <eos>
It has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality. <eos>
I was not impressed by this product. <eos>
Nice headset priced right. <eos>
I only hear garbage for audio. <eos>
Excellent bluetooth headset. <eos>
It has all the features I want <eos>
Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?. <eos>
AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS. <eos>
This case seems well made. <eos>
Disappointed with battery. <eos>
Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should. <eos>
good protection and does not make phone too bulky. <eos>
A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget. <eos>
This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it. <eos>
I love this thing! <eos>
Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e. <eos>
VERY DISAPPOINTED. <eos>
I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great!<eos>
The buttons for on and off are bad. <eos>
Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support. <eos>
I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool. <eos>
These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously. <eos>
Buy a different phone - but not this. <eos>
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly. <eos>
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds. <eos>
A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died. <eos>
It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes. <eos>
Great for iPODs too. <eos>
This device is great in several situations:1.)<eos>
Mic Doesn't work. <eos>
Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet, I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying. <eos>
Great choice! <eos>
Nice docking station for home or work. <eos>
This is a beautiful phone. <eos>
Love this product. <eos>
Do Not Buy for D807...wrongly advertised for D807. <eos>
This is a great little item. <eos>
I love this phone , It is very handy and has a lot of features . <eos>
I purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working!!!!!!!!! <eos>
I wear it everyday and it holds up very well. <eos>
Not a good bargain. <eos>
Well packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended. <eos>
The battery runs down quickly. <eos>
This item worked great, but it broke after 6 months of use. <eos>
The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them. <eos>
This phone works great. <eos>
The construction of the headsets is poor. <eos>
Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper! <eos>
The phone loads super! <eos>
For a product that costs as much as this one does, I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does. <eos>
Made very sturdy. <eos>
Worked great!. <eos>
The ear buds only play music in one ear. <eos>
Dont waste your money... <eos>
Will order from them again! <eos>
If you plan to use this in a car forget about it. <eos>
I found this product to be waaay too big. <eos>
Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using. <eos>
I'm very disappointed with my decision. <eos>
Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone. <eos>
Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet. <eos>
Definitely a bargain. <eos>
The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase. <eos>
I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger. <eos>
Pros:-Good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more. <eos>
That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case). <eos>
I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit. <eos>
The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.<eos>
I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work. <eos>
Sound quality on both end is excellent, I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2. <eos>
This phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful. <eos>
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case. <eos>
Great product, fast shipping!. <eos>
Absolutely great. <eos>
The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad. <eos>
i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it. <eos>
It is very comfortable on the ear. <eos>
It has been a winner for us. <eos>
)Setup couldn't have been simpler. <eos>
I've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I've found that fits my ear comfortably. <eos>
Could not get strong enough signal. <eos>
Iam very pleased with my purchase. <eos>
Bad Quality. <eos>
Gets the job done. <eos>
Great audio!. <eos>
Basically the service was very bad. <eos>
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!. <eos>
I've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but I really like it. <eos>
The BT headset was such a disapoinment. <eos>
It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it. <eos>
The accompanied software is almost brilliant. <eos>
Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage. <eos>
!I definitly recommend!! <eos>
Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!. <eos>
The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed. <eos>
Very good stuff for the price. <eos>
My headset works just peachy-keen. <eos>
In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement. <eos>
Voice recognition is tremendous! <eos>
What a waste. <eos>
During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars. <eos>
I was not happy with this item. <eos>
very disappointed. <eos>
The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally. <eos>
I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I'm glad I did. <eos>
What a waste of time! <eos>
Its reception is very very poor. <eos>
Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED. <eos>
After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden. <eos>
I Was Hoping for More. <eos>
Audio Quality is poor, very poor. <eos>
I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve! <eos>
I know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.Well, this one works great. <eos>
I've bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these. <eos>
This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used. <eos>
Nice quality build, unlike some cheap s*** out there. <eos>
This item is fantastic and works perfectly! <eos>
And I just love the colors! <eos>
All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it. <eos>
Great charger. <eos>
This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate. <eos>
Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone. <eos>
I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans. <eos>
Great Value. <eos>
Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working. <eos>
The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear, with great graphics. <eos>
doesn't last long. <eos>
One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side. <eos>
EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!. <eos>
Thank you for wasting my money. <eos>
How can that be?The audio quality is poor. <eos>
The iGo chargers and tips are really great. <eos>
The file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great. <eos>
Superb Phone on a Great Network. <eos>
I connected my wife's bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case. <eos>
I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.<eos>
It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device. <eos>
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you! <eos>
Don't buy this product. <eos>
I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear. <eos>
The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome. <eos>
I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it. <eos>
Incredible!. <eos>
Design Flaw?. <eos>
Great phone!. <eos>
Waste of 13 bucks.<eos>
But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I'm lost. <eos>
The replacement died in a few weeks. <eos>
Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy.. <eos>
Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone. <eos>
I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more. <eos>
Not impressed. <eos>
Light weight, I hardly notice it is there. <eos>
You'll love how thin it is. <eos>
Bad Choice. <eos>
The pleather case doesn't fit. <eos>
useless phone, simply deaf. <eos>
The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp. <eos>
All in all I think it was a good investment. <eos>
It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call. <eos>
The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters. <eos>
Battery lasts only a few hours. <eos>
great headset, very impressed - H500. <eos>
The "1.2" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good7.<eos>
I've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me. <eos>
Good transmit audio. <eos>
We are sending it back. <eos>
I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway. <eos>
If you hate earbugs, avoid this phone by all means. <eos>
Great price also! <eos>
The range is very decent, I've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception/sound quality issues. <eos>
fast service. <eos>
I would highly recommend this. <eos>
I would recommend this. <eos>
I also didn't like the "on" button, it felt like it would crack with use. <eos>
WORST PHONE EVER. <eos>
I'm still infatuated with this phone. <eos>
Freezes frequently4. <eos>
It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is. <eos>
Simple, lightweight and great fit. <eos>
All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola. <eos>
There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before. <eos>
These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent. <eos>
I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair. <eos>
I'm a bit disappointed. <eos>
I have had this phone for over a year now, and I will tell you, its not that great. <eos>
The battery is completely useless to me. <eos>
What a big waste of time. <eos>
Don't waste your $$$ on this one. <eos>
Great sound and service. <eos>
Really pleased with this product so far. <eos>
One of my favorite purchases ever. <eos>
best bluetooth on the market. <eos>
Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .I recommend you this case !! <eos>
I was very excited to get this headset because I thought it was really cute. <eos>
Do not make the same mistake as me. <eos>
Big Disappointment with calendar sync. <eos>
the phone was unusable and was not new. <eos>
Worst Customer Service Ever. <eos>
No additional ear gels provided, and no instructions whatsoever. <eos>
It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset. <eos>
Worth every penny. <eos>
Excellent wallet type phone case. <eos>
Nice headphones for the price and they work great! <eos>
Internet is excrutiatingly slow. <eos>
It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case. <eos>
It's fits like a glove and is strong, secure, and durable. <eos>
O my gosh the best phone I have ever had. <eos>
It's very attractive and appears to be of good quality. <eos>
I love all the features and form factor. <eos>
This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it <eos>
poor quality and service. <eos>
The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary. <eos>
Great Earpiece. <eos>
Excellent hands free tool. <eos>
Great for using with your home stereo. <eos>
Good product - incredible value. <eos>
Only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far. <eos>
Works great. <eos>
Absolutel junk. <eos>
THAT one didn't work either. <eos>
Battery life is real good. <eos>
Returned 8 hours later. <eos>
It's a great item. <eos>
Don't waste your money!. <eos>
Love this headset! <eos>
Not only will it drain your player, but may also potentially fry it. <eos>
Worked perfectly! <eos>
Unreliable - I'm giving up. <eos>
I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality. <eos>
Avoid this one if you can. <eos>
Reversible plug works great. <eos>
I wasted my little money with this earpiece. <eos>
Very good phone. <eos>
Best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful. <eos>
Comfort for our whole family. <eos>
Good product, good seller. <eos>
I love this bluetooth! <eos>
First of all, it doesn't wear well. <eos>
I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics. <eos>
I got it because it was so small and adorable. <eos>
Great phone!. <eos>
I wouldn't recommend buying this product. <eos>
Piece of Junk. <eos>
Poorly contstruct hinge. <eos>
This item is great, installed it, let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems <eos>
Great Phone. <eos>
Don't buy it. <eos>
Excellent Phone. <eos>
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE. <eos>
The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent. <eos>
This is hands down the best phone I've ever had. <eos>
Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen. <eos>
This one works and was priced right. <eos>
Customer service was terrible. <eos>
Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i. <eos>
Sending it back. <eos>
Now I know that I made a wise decision. <eos>
Someone shouldve invented this sooner. <eos>
Good price. <eos>
Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good. <eos>
I received it quickly and it works great!! <eos>
Has been working great. <eos>
As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak. <eos>
They do not care about the consumer one bit. <eos>
This is a good battery, and it got here really fast. <eos>
The instruction manual is lacking. <eos>
Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case. <eos>
Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new. <eos>
The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena. <eos>
It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG). <eos>
We have gotten a lot of compliments on it. <eos>
This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving. <eos>
I want my money back. <eos>
I love this device. <eos>
I am also very happy with the price. <eos>
I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately. <eos>
The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds. <eos>
I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem. <eos>
I have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when I am home, but you cant not hear anything. <eos>
good item, low price. <eos>
However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games. <eos>
The plug did not work very well. <eos>
AMAZON SUCKS. <eos>
Rip off---- Over charge shipping. <eos>
VERY comfortable. <eos>
The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago. <eos>
The reception is excellent! <eos>
It fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days. <eos>
very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset. <eos>
1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.<eos>
Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive. <eos>
Very disappointing. <eos>
It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality. <eos>
It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it. <eos>
Excellent sound quality. <eos>
Was not happy. <eos>
A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!! <eos>
New Battery works great in phone. <eos>
Worst customer service. <eos>
I've dropped my phone more times than I can say, even on concrete and my phone is still great (knock on wood!). <eos>
Reception is terrible and full of static. <eos>
Good audio quality. <eos>
This little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier. <eos>
I was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal. <eos>
Were JERKS on the phone. <eos>
Works like a charm.. Works as advertised. <eos>
Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life. <eos>
Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible. <eos>
Excellent starter wireless headset. <eos>
The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing. <eos>
The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset. <eos>
First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever. <eos>
The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT! <eos>
The microphone also works well, but (according to people I have called) it applifies everything. <eos>
Nice design and quality. <eos>
Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down. <eos>
It is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission. <eos>
bad fit, way too big. <eos>
It definitely was not as good as my S11.<eos>
awesome device. <eos>
Waste of money. <eos>
I had ordered a motorola data cable, got a very well finished and working product. <eos>
Love This Phone. <eos>
I was looking for this headset for a long time and now that I've got it I couldn't be happier. <eos>
I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason. <eos>
Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year. <eos>
Battery life is also great! <eos>
The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months. <eos>
Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player. <eos>
This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear. <eos>
Protects the phone on all sides. <eos>
This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network. <eos>
Clear Skype Calls, Long Battery Life, Long Range. <eos>
Soyo technology sucks. <eos>
Great Hands Free Device. <eos>
you can even take self portraits with the outside (exterior) display, very cool. <eos>
Same problem as others have mentioned. <eos>
After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well. <eos>
Magical Help. <eos>
The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service. <eos>
Poor sound quality. <eos>
The best phone in market :). <eos>
It worked very well. <eos>
The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well. <eos>
Exactly what I wanted. <eos>
The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today. <eos>
This is a great deal. <eos>
Excellent product, I am very satisfied with the purchase. <eos>
I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try. <eos>
Better than you'd expect. <eos>
Using all earpieces, left or right, this thing will not stay on my ear. <eos>
Great product and price. <eos>
Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple ! <eos>
Still Waiting...... I'm sure this item would work well.. if I ever recieve it! <eos>
what a disappointment <eos>
Very prompt service. <eos>
Excellent product for the price. <eos>
Very pleased with this headset. <eos>
don't waste your money and time. <eos>
I especially love the long battery life. <eos>
It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out. <eos>
Works great. <eos>
Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy. <eos>
I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service. <eos>
I'll be looking for a new earpiece. <eos>
I highly recommend this device to everyone! <eos>
Jawbone Era is awesome too! <eos>
We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement <eos>
After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset. <eos>
I have used several phone in two years, but this one is the best. <eos>
An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!. <eos>
This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made. <eos>
Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk. <eos>
The plastic breaks really easy on this clip. <eos>
Price is good too. <eos>
Don't make the same mistake I did. <eos>
Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone. <eos>
I'm using it with an iriver SPINN (with case) and it fits fine. <eos>
Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap. <eos>
Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception. <eos>
every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it. <eos>
Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model. <eos>
IT'S REALLY EASY. <eos>
My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect. <eos>
Fantastic earphones. <eos>
It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car. <eos>
Low Quality. <eos>
I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone. <eos>
But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before. <eos>
Warning - Stay away. <eos>
I wish I could return the unit and get back my money. <eos>
Awsome Device Works Great!!. <eos>
I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.<eos>
If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone. <eos>
Very Displeased. <eos>
I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone. <eos>
They made this case too small and is very difficult to install. <eos>
Restored my phone to like new performance. <eos>
I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value. <eos>
Does not fit. <eos>
Very happy with this product. <eos>
The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone. <eos>
There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset. <eos>
i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced. <eos>
Portable and it works. <eos>
My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great. <eos>
I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning. <eos>
I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again. <eos>
Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses. <eos>
Timely shipment and quality product. <eos>
Nice solid keyboard. <eos>
Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly. <eos>
Horrible phone. <eos>
BT50 battery junk!. <eos>
We would recommend these to others. <eos>
Cant get the software to work with my computer. <eos>
Disappointed!. <eos>
poor voice clarity. <eos>
The battery works great! <eos>
No buyers remorse on this one!. <eos>
Very disappointed in AccessoryOne. <eos>
I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers. <eos>
Looks great and is strong." <eos>
I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it. <eos>
The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome. <eos>
Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear. <eos>
Great software for Motorolas. <eos>
The delivery was on time. <eos>
Very easy to use. <eos>
Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV). <eos>
The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown. <eos>
It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous. <eos>
I'd like to return it. <eos>
The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems. <eos>
Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple. <eos>
After charging overnight, these batteries work great. <eos>
You won't regret it! <eos>
I love this phone!. <eos>
A Disappointment. <eos>
Its not user friendly. <eos>
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect. <eos>
Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem. <eos>
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute. <eos>
This PDA rocks. <eos>
It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles. <eos>
I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price! <eos>
I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service. <eos>
Pretty piece of junk. <eos>
Plug was the wrong size. <eos>
Works as described. <eos>
Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.<eos>
Bad Purchase. <eos>
WELL IM SATISFIED. <eos>
The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter. <eos>
This battery is an excellent bargain! <eos>
Defective crap. <eos>
I would have given no star if I was able. <eos>
I wear glasses and it fits fine with them. <eos>
The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing. <eos>
I would not recommend this item to anyone. <eos>
The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad. <eos>
great...no problems at all!. <eos>
As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens. <eos>
This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching. <eos>
You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not. <eos>
The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too. <eos>
I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far. <eos>
very good product, well made. <eos>
Mobile Phone Tools are a must have. <eos>
I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone. <eos>
I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source. <eos>
The phone is sturdy and waterproof. <eos>
I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone. <eos>
My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5) <eos>
Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price! <eos>
I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead. <eos>
I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great. <eos>
Works great!. <eos>
REALLY UGLY. <eos>
horrible, had to switch 3 times. <eos>
The noise shield is incrediable. <eos>
No real improvement. <eos>
Razr Battery - Good buy. <eos>
Keep up the good work Amazon!! <eos>
They refuse to refund or replace. <eos>
Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening. <eos>
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing. <eos>
Great case and price! <eos>
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing. <eos>
Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch. <eos>
Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place. <eos>
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity. <eos>
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly. <eos>
I am glad I purchased it. <eos>
I've missed numerous calls because of this reason. <eos>
Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this. <eos>
Don't buy this product. <eos>
sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone. <eos>
No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid. <eos>
Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would. <eos>
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration. <eos>
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever. <eos>
I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better. <eos>
I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality. <eos>
Thank you for such great service. <eos>
Its a total package. <eos>
The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again. <eos>
I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.<eos>
It's AGGRAVATING! <eos>
Great product for the price!. <eos>
I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use <eos>
Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone! <eos>
None of it works, just don't buy it. <eos>
Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off. <eos>
Please dont waste your money. <eos>
All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase. <eos>
If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it. <eos>
Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design. <eos>
Disapointing Results. <eos>
Cumbersome design. <eos>
Great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!! <eos>
Great Product. <eos>
It's A PIECE OF CRAP! <eos>
My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!! <eos>
This fixes all the problems. <eos>
Worst ever. <eos>
I am very happy <eos>
I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions. <eos>
I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying "what?" <eos>
The battery life is highly unacceptable. <eos>
That company is a joke. <eos>
It does everything the description said it would. <eos>
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset. <eos>
It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time. <eos>
Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data. <eos>
Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls. <eos>
It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not. <eos>
Better than expected. <eos>
It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them. <eos>
Battery is holding up well. <eos>
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product. <eos>
I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with. <eos>
I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking. <eos>
Sprint - terrible customer service. <eos>
Linked to my phone without effort. <eos>
THey are so cool! <eos>
Easy to use. <eos>
Better Than New. <eos>
What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea... <eos>
Piece of trash. <eos>
A pretty good product. <eos>
This is a great phone!. <eos>
For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend. <eos>
Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing. <eos>
The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking. <eos>
Those phones are working just fine now. <eos>
I am more than happy with this product. <eos>
Poor Construction. <eos>
This is infuriating. <eos>
Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman. <eos>
Sprint charges for this service. <eos>
It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap. <eos>
It fits my ear well and is comfortable on. <eos>
It doesn't work in Europe or Asia. <eos>
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming. <eos>
I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear. <eos>
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price. <eos>
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.<eos>
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone. <eos>
Poor product. <eos>
However I needed some better instructions. <eos>
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs. <eos>
Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver). <eos>
Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack. <eos>
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS <eos>
This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!. <eos>
Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point. <eos>
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul. <eos>
Very Dissapointing Performance. <eos>
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone. <eos>
This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand. <eos>
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear. <eos>
I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family. <eos>
Don't bother - go to the store. <eos>
I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color! <eos>
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed. <eos>
You get what you pay for I guess. <eos>
Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection. <eos>
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it. <eos>
These are fabulous! <eos>
However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up. <eos>
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent. <eos>
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer. <eos>
Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call. <eos>
Very wind-resistant. <eos>
Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for. <eos>
They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried. <eos>
I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck. <eos>
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something! <eos>
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are. <eos>
Great phone. <eos>
When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides. <eos>
I'm pleased. <eos>
Battery is terrible. <eos>
I found the product to be easy to set up and use. <eos>
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear. <eos>
Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE. <eos>
The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work. <eos>
No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great. <eos>
Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor. <eos>
The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high. <eos>
Talk about USELESS customer service. <eos>
It felt too light and "tinny.". <eos>
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in. <eos>
I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price. <eos>
I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones. <eos>
Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color. <eos>
Does everything it should and more. <eos>
I could not recommend these more. <eos>
Nice Sound. <eos>
Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!! <eos>
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with. <eos>
Setup went very smoothly. <eos>
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it. <eos>
A must study for anyone interested in the "worst sins" of industrial design. <eos>
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off. <eos>
It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip. <eos>
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping. <eos>
Can't upload ringtones from a third party. <eos>
Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked. <eos>
Truly awful. <eos>
It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did. <eos>
The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud). <eos>
And none of the tones is acceptable. <eos>
camera color balance is AWFUL. <eos>
This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless. <eos>
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat! <eos>
Chinese Forgeries Abound!. <eos>
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell. <eos>
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used. <eos>
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well. <eos>
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service! <eos>
Works well. <eos>
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone. <eos>
Clear crisp sound. <eos>
I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well. <eos>
The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast. <eos>
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear. <eos>
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster. <eos>
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips. <eos>
It doesn't make you look cool. <eos>
Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all. <eos>
Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day. <eos>
Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player. <eos>
You can't beat the price on these. <eos>
* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously! <eos>
lightweight and works well. <eos>
So just beware. <eos>
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC. <eos>
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation. <eos>
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up. <eos>
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since. <eos>
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i. <eos>
Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM. <eos>
It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem. <eos>
Poor quality. <eos>
jabra ear gels "R" the best!. <eos>
Not worth it. <eos>
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced. <eos>
It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.<eos>
Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc). <eos>
It was a great phone. <eos>
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre. <eos>
Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet. <eos>
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand. <eos>
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality! <eos>
Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me! <eos>
In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim "Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!? <eos>
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful. <eos>
Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape. <eos>
It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more. <eos>
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke. <eos>
This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something. <eos>
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears. <eos>
T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere. <eos>
Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold. <eos>
We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros <eos>
Provides good protection and looks classy, too. <eos>
Krussel Always good. <eos>
The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc. <eos>
The design is very good.4. <eos>
I great reception all the time. <eos>
I would highly recommend this product. <eos>
Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas! <eos>
It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320. <eos>
Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing. <eos>
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you! <eos>
Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is <eos>
stay away from this store, be careful. <eos>
This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME. <eos>
Does not fit. <eos>
.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs. <eos>
It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time. <eos>
disappointing. <eos>
Blue Ant is easy to use. <eos>
Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item. <eos>
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this. <eos>
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use. <eos>
It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother. <eos>
The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed. <eos>
The sound quality is excellent as well. <eos>
Its the best headset I have used. <eos>
Would not reccommend. <eos>
They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date. <eos>
Just what I wanted. <eos>
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone. <eos>
wont work right or atleast for me. <eos>
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic. <eos>
But now that it is "out of warranty" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it. <eos>
Great product. <eos>
Crisp and Clear. <eos>
AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.<eos>
VERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor. <eos>
I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem. <eos>
The reception has been generally good. <eos>
Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!. <eos>
Great bluetooth!. <eos>
I highly recommend this case. <eos>
WORTHWHILE. <eos>
This is a great deal. <eos>
After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part. <eos>
I am sorry I made this purchase. <eos>
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear. <eos>
Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount. <eos>
It was horrible!. <eos>
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt. <eos>
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first. <eos>
They work about 2 weeks then break. <eos>
It is simple to use and I like it. <eos>
It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results! <eos>
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting. <eos>
NOT WHAT I WANTED. <eos>
I own 2 of these cases and would order another. <eos>
Great Phone. <eos>
I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase. <eos>
The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. <eos>
Perfect for the PS3. <eos>
Five star Plus, plus. <eos>
A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me. <eos>
$50 Down the drain. <eos>
I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great. <eos>
Good , works fine. <eos>
For the price this was a great deal. <eos>
Great price, too! <eos>
If there is a wind, it is completely useless. <eos>
Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it! <eos>
Does Not Work. <eos>
At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr). <eos>
The reception through this headset is excellent. <eos>
2 thumbs up to this seller <eos>
I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight. <eos>
Improper description.... I had to return it. <eos>
#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.<eos>
Battery charge-life is quite long. <eos>
The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well. <eos>
Battery has no life. <eos>
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing. <eos>
Product is exactly as described. <eos>
Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't. <eos>
Doesn't do the job. <eos>
I would recommend it. <eos>
Plan on ordering from them again and again. <eos>
That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well. <eos>
I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one. <eos>
They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too). <eos>
Awkward to use and unreliable. <eos>
The shipping time was also very quick! <eos>
Not as good as I had hoped. <eos>
Good case!. <eos>
Doesn't Work. <eos>
Really good product. <eos>
Unfortunately it did not work. <eos>
All three broke within two months of use. <eos>
dont buy it. <eos>
My father has the V265, and the battery is dying. <eos>
However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one. <eos>
The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently. <eos>
Horrible, horrible protector. <eos>
I don't like this Nokia either. <eos>
Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3. <eos>
I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare. <eos>
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon. <eos>
the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!! <eos>
Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette. <eos>
Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with. <eos>
It's not what it says it is. <eos>
Stay Away From the Q!. <eos>
Used and dirty. <eos>
Very unreliable service from T-mobile ! <eos>
Not good enough for the price. <eos>
I bought two of them and neither will charge. <eos>
It looks very nice. <eos>
This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer. <eos>
I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it. <eos>
These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet. <eos>
Comfortable in my hand. <eos>
Just does not work. <eos>
Poor Reliability. <eos>
(It works!) <eos>
If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing. <eos>
Terrible product, and waste of money! <eos>
Last time buying from you. <eos>
It was a waste of my money. <eos>
So far it has worked like a charm. <eos>
I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good. <eos>
But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone. <eos>
Would recommend this item. <eos>
It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation. <eos>
Nice case, feels good in your hands. <eos>
The item received was Counterfeit. <eos>
Just really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had. <eos>
Works fine. <eos>
I received my headset in good time and was happy with it. <eos>
I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip. <eos>
My sister has one also and she loves it. <eos>
Good Quality. <eos>
This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon. <eos>
Excellent dual-purpose headset. <eos>
Excellent!. <eos>
Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.<eos>
It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside. <eos>
The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint. <eos>
Having trouble with volume. <eos>
The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears. <eos>
WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!. <eos>
I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far. <eos>
When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off. <eos>
I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort. <eos>
Best headset ever!!!. <eos>
Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support. <eos>
The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap. <eos>
Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips. <eos>
Excellent product for the price. <eos>
Bad Reception. <eos>
This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!! <eos>
It was quite comfortable in the ear. <eos>
Great phone. <eos>
Don't buy this product - It fails!. <eos>
Everything about this product is wrong.First <eos>
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature. <eos>
This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts. <eos>
Terrible phone holder. <eos>
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly. <eos>
I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell. <eos>
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily. <eos>
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look. <eos>
But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product. <eos>
How stupid is that? <eos>
I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting. <eos>
Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors. <eos>
Good show, Samsung. <eos>
It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed. <eos>
Couldn't figure it out <eos>
My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it. <eos>
So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it. <eos>
While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop. <eos>
Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!. <eos>
Works for me. <eos>
Saggy, floppy piece of junk. <eos>
much better than the hard plastic cases. <eos>
It also had a new problem. <eos>
Happy so far!. <eos>
cool phone. <eos>
Works good. <eos>
Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right. <eos>
It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two. <eos>
but it is great, i would really recommend it <eos>
Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it. <eos>
As I said above....PRETTY USELESS! <eos>
Never got it!!!!! <eos>
This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise. <eos>
[...] down the drain because of a weak snap! <eos>
Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone. <eos>
You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off." <eos>
However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls. <eos>
I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off. <eos>
The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase. <eos>
I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside. <eos>
A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I. <eos>
I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine. <eos>
The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low. <eos>
I'm returning them. <eos>
I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap. <eos>
It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable. <eos>
I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family. <eos>
Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound. <eos>
nice leather. <eos>
I had to purchase a different case. <eos>
It is a joy to use. <eos>
Very much disappointed with this company. <eos>
Very satisifed with that. <eos>
It didn't charge for me. <eos>
Buttons are too small. <eos>
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW. <eos>
Love it.. Great armband. <eos>
I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic. <eos>
However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons. <eos>
I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision. <eos>
I was very impressed with the price of the cases. <eos>
Also makes it easier to hold on to. <eos>
I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great! <eos>
It's pretty easy. <eos>
I cannot make calls at certain places. <eos>
however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does. <eos>
Beautiful styling though. <eos>
This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back. <eos>
I'm trying to return it for a refund. <eos>
I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked. <eos>
Excellent product. <eos>
Earbud piece breaks easily. <eos>
Lousy product. <eos>
This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone. <eos>
It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet. <eos>
SWEETEST PHONE!!! <eos>
:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine. <eos>
It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal. <eos>
Not enough volume. <eos>
Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory <eos>
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor. <eos>
don't waste your money. <eos>
I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product. <eos>
Adapter does not provide enough charging current. <eos>
There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake. <eos>
You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered. <eos>
Phone falls out easily. <eos>
It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk. <eos>
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use. <eos>
I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work. <eos>
Painful on the ear. <eos>
Lasted one day and then blew up. <eos>
disappointed. <eos>
Kind of flops around. <eos>
The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face. <eos>
What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone. <eos>
Item Does Not Match Picture. <eos>
The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda). <eos>
You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once! <eos>
_exit
